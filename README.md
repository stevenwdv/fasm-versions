# flat assembler version list

fasm version list used in [stevenwdv/setup-fasm](https://github.com/stevenwdv/setup-fasm), with workflow checking for new versions. [`fasm_versions.json`](https://github.com/stevenwdv/fasm-versions/blob/v1/fasm_versions.json) contains the list of versions.

This contains unpacked TypeScript, which is kind of ugly, but I don't want to commit JS if I don't have to and including this with ts-node works.
